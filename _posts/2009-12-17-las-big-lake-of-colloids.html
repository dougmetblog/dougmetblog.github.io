The New York Times is running a piece about tap water and the regulation thereof called "<a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html">That Tap Water Is Legal but May Be Unhealthy</a>". One particular contaminant becomes dangerous on exposure to sunlight so, at a lake in Los Angeles, they've tipped 400,000 plastic balls into the lake to block out the sunlight.<br /><br />Perhaps this shows I've been in stat-mech too long. All I could think about upon seeing this picture was - "cool, a massive 2D elastic disc simulation!".<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/SyocFgZ8igI/AAAAAAAABVg/i1GrEpR1VlM/s1600-h/NYTballs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/SyocFgZ8igI/AAAAAAAABVg/i1GrEpR1VlM/s400/NYTballs.jpg" /></a></div><br />It's quite interesting where the crystal structure is interrupted - each one of those interfaces costs a lot of free energy. You can also see it's not truly 2D as along certain stress lines the particles have gone up and over to reduce the energy.<br /><br />I wonder if it's in equilibrium or whether it'll age with time...<br /><br />This is what science can do to you :-s<br /><br />Don't know what fair use would be for stealing this photo but hopefully if I <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/12/17/us/20091217WATER_index.html">link to the NYT enough</a> they won't mind - go and click on one of their ads of something...
