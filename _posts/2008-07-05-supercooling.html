Ok, a bit of proper science to try and establish some balance.  This is a bit of a lazy post but I did mention I'm busy writing my thesis. On supercooled liquids...<br /><br />Supercooled water is just water that is below its freezing point but for one reason or another didn't crystalise.  It's a form of metastable equilibrium.  If you give it a big enough kick then it can escape and this happens<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DpiUZI_3o8s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DpiUZI_3o8s&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />And you can do it with beer<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4i11hVEVPdM&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4i11hVEVPdM&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />If you keep cooling it further then you eventually get glass, and that's all glass is.  Now my stuff is more interested on the supercooled goes to glass bit rather than freezing beer but you get the idea.
