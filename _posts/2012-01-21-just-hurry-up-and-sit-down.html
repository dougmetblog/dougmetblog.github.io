As a semi frequent flyer, and incredibly impatient stand-behinderer I couldn't resist linking to this -&nbsp;<a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.85.011130">Time needed to board an airplane: A power law and the structure behind it</a>&nbsp;from a Norwegian group, Vidar Frette and Per Hemmer.<br /><br />Boarding strategy is of great importance to airlines, where the turn around time of planes – especially short haul – can make a real dent in profits. For the authors of this paper, however, it seems they just think it's a neat model to test out 1D problems where the particles are distinguishable, rather than the more common&nbsp;indistinguishable particles. In a traffic model the cars are usually identical, whereas here the passengers have a specific seat booking. Statistically this makes a difference.<br /><br />Of course many people do look at specific strategies. For example <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221701002946">here</a>, it seems that it's difficult to think up a strategy that beats random loading. One would think that loading back-to-front would be better but this is not the case. A quick google search finds this nice page from&nbsp;<a href="http://menkes76.com/projects/boarding/boarding.htm">Menkes van den Briel</a>. There you can see videos of all the different strategies.<br /><br />Unfortunately&nbsp;the best strategy seems to involve seating people in order of window/middle/aisle. Not great if you're sitting next to your kids.<br /><br />All of which did remind me that it is much quicker boarding when you don't have seat bookings. When I fly to England using a certain orange-themed airline, that doesn't book seats, there's an initial&nbsp;mêlée followed by reasonably rapid sitting down. On a certain royal blue-themed airline it takes forever for a plane half the size to get sat down.<br /><br />My suggestion is that I should be allowed to starting poking, with increasing frequency and verbal abuse, anyone that I deem to be taking too long to put their bag away.
