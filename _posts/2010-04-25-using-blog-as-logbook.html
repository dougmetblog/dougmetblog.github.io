Last productivity post for a while I promise, then back to proper physics.<br /><br />I'm trying out using a private blog (secured and unlisted etc) as a logbook. Logbooks are so important, the first time you realise you need one it's too late. My reasoning for going online goes:<br /><ol><li>I can access from anywhere, including emailing in posts from my phone. For example I could take a photo of a whiteboard discussion and send it to the blog so I won't forget about it.</li><li>&nbsp;It's safely backed up on the servers of whoever's hosting it.</li><li>I'm more likely to actually make entries because it's easy.</li><li>A blog is much like a logbook anyway so it's naturally suited.</li></ol>I can see some downsides but they're all pretty minor. Security could be an issue but how sensitive is the information you put in your logbook? Well mine isn't much, I don't want to accidentally broadcast my latest idea but it wouldn't cause a new <a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?q=climategate">climategate</a> or anything. Besides, I think it's pretty secure.<br /><br />I've chosen to use <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> for my logbook for one simple reason. The LaTeX integration is fantastic. It's so good I'd consider moving this blog if it wasn't such a pain (for the record I otherwise like blogger). In wordpress you do this:<br /><br /><code>I will now insert an equation here, $latex E=mc^2$, inline with the text.</code><br /><br />which would look like<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/S9RkAx88R9I/AAAAAAAABes/s5RMlz5rQeA/s1600/wordpresslogbook.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/S9RkAx88R9I/AAAAAAAABes/s5RMlz5rQeA/s320/wordpresslogbook.png" /></a></div>although the superscripts do appear to have messed up the alignment... Otherwise it does a brilliant job at interpreting the tex and inserting the image. If you need a lot of LaTeX then there are programmes that convert between regular .tex files and the wordpress format.<br /><br />There are similar things available for blogger but I think you lose your source code in a more drastic way. Anyway, I'm going to see how it goes.
