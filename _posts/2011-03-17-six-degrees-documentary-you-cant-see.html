A while back the BBC put on an documentary about networks called "Six Degrees". Normally when you see a documentary about a field that you're vaguely related to you feel a bit sick because they did it all wrong.<br /><br />Well I have worked in networks a bit and I thought Six Degrees was excellent. It got a great balance of the historical study of networks and then it ran its own version of the Milgram experiment which was mostly used as a plot device to keep driving the story forwards. The people involved (Watts, Strogatz, Barabasi) were all very entertaining and successfully transmitted the excitement of scientific discovery.<br /><br />Suffice to say it was great. I had planned to link to it and then discuss it a little bit. Annoyingly the BBC have switched off the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kdtvv">iPlayer</a> version of the programme and they now appear to have shutdown the version at <a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/six-degrees-of-separation/">top documentaries</a>.<br /><br />I know the beeb don't want to give away content for free but it strikes me that a resource this useful (I'd even recommend it to scientists new to the field) should be kept live. Instead it's buried away where it's now useless. Scientists are always told about public engagement, well unblock this film - engage!<br /><br />I'm going to write to them an encourage them to let it free, then perhaps instead of a rant about the BBC we can talk about some science.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As you can see from the comments, the BBC didn't make the film so they can't keep it online. I can't work out how to get a DVD yet but when I find out I'll put up a link and then can get on talking about networks. In the mean time, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qfZaNQAACAAJ&dq=editions:QTWHAAAACAAJ&hl=en&ei=XwOGTeuEIMyChQeI-JWyBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA">this book</a>, "<a href="http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=075381689X">Small World</a>" by <a href="http://markbuchanan.net/">Mark Buchanan</a> is well worth a read.
