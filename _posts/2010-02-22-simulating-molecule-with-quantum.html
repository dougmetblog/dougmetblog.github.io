<a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.030502">Simulating a molecule</a><br /><br />There's a fairly nifty paper out in PRL on simulating a molecule with a quantum computer. In principle doing calculations on quantum systems will be much faster with quantum computers (when they become a reality) thanks to being able to hold the computer in a superposition of states. These guys have had a bash using an NMR based "computer" - it's pretty fun.
