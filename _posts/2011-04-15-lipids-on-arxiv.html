A while ago I discussed <a href="http://www.kineticallyconstrained.com/2009/08/biological-membranes.html">lipid membranes</a> and how they could exhibit critical behaviour. There were some lovely pictures on criticality on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) which are sort of model cell walls. That work was done by Sarah Keller and friends in Seattle.<br /><br />This morning on the arXiv I saw this new paper, also by Sarah:<br /><br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2613">Dynamic critical exponent in a 2D lipid membrane with conserved order parameter</a><br /><br />They look at the critical dynamics of the GUV's surface. Being embedded in a 3D fluid does have its consequences so they've attempted to account for the effect of hydrodynamic interactions. I haven't poured over their model but the paper looks really nice.
