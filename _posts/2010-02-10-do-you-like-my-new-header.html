OK, so I'm no Banksy, but I do like green. I'll probably be playing around with themes a bit over the next few weeks.<br /><br />Hopefully the header captures how "kinetically constrained" can apply to complex statistical systems and that sort of stuck feeling that I can never quite shake off. Look at me full of bollocks, maybe I can get on Newsnight review or something.
