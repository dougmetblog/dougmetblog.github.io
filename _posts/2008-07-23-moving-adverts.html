A couple of weeks ago I was in London and passing through Liverpool Street tube station.  Something that I've been dreading for years has finally started; they're now projecting moving adverts on to the wall.  They've had the LCD screens on the escalators for ages now, they're not great but they only fill a small part of your peripheral vision - they're after the rest.<br /><br />TFL try and <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/8730.aspx">sell this</a> as something great for the commuters<blockquote>We believe that this technology will enhance passengers' journeys<br /></blockquote>Really?  Are you sure it won't get on their nerves?  Would you stop it if it did? The eventual aim is to have every pixel of your periphery flashing and shouting so that your brain is so confused with the unmanageable amount of information that you'll do anything they tell you.  Or stumble in front of a train.<br /><br />It's an inevitability, an arms race.  If you cover every square inch in posters then, per square inch, they're all worth less.  So to make your milliacre more valuable  it must now move.  Soon they will all move.  Then they'll start shouting at you, then they'll get linked to your oyster card so they'll be calling your name.  Worse, linked to your nectar card so they can chase you down the street offering you carefully selected products you might like.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees with me: <a href="http://waimonlie.wordpress.com/2008/06/30/28/">this advertising blogger</a> thinks it's great and shows how hi-tech we are.  TFL clearly like it.  Anyone else?  I'd really like to know.<br /><br />I have the attention span of a pea.  It takes nothing for me to lose track of what the hell I was thinking, what someone just said or even why I got on this train in the first place.  Please, I'm begging,  leave my poor brain alone!
