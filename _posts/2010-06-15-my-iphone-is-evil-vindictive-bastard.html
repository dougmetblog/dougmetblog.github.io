Yes I know you're supposed to say phone and not iPhone, but I think it's relevant here.<br /><br />Being a clever smarty pants, when I landed in the Czech Republic I switched my phone to Prague time and it took care of everything. Oo, isn't it clever! No. For some bizarre reason overnight last night it decided that I couldn't possibly still be in Czech Republic and I must be back in the UK. So this morning I managed to miss the one talk I really wanted to see (Sharon Glotzers tetrahedra talk) because I was on bloody London time.<br /><br />So you can keep your retina display and your megapixels, Mr Jobs - get the bloody time right! Just about ready to throw this thing at the wall. Oh, but it is so pretty...
