Welcome to my new blog.  I haven't quite worked out what to do with it yet but I think it's good to have a blog, the internet's already full of useless crap so this isn't going to make it any worse.<br /><br />Right now I'm writing my thesis so I doubt I'll be putting much on here but when I do I suspect it'll mainly be based on the two things: physicsy stuff and statistics stuff.  The former should be mainly positive (things I think are really interesting) and the latter will be mostly negative (ranting about stats-abuse).  I guess we'll see how it goes.
