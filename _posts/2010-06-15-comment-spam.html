I'm getting killed by comment spam at the moment. You'd really think Google would be better at stopping it but I don't want to get into that. Anyway, given I don't have as much internet access at the moment I can't mop up the spam quick enough so for a little while I'm going to have either moderation or require openid signing in. It's a shame because I really want to keep comments open.<br /><br />Update: login didn't work so for now it's bloody moderation.<br /><br />Update 2: Constantly catching comment spam. Wordpress has a facility to block comments with more than one hyperlink. I'm seriously looking at moving the site over.
