<p>Continuing what has become a quarterly theme here is summer's post:</p> <p>One reason for a drop in blogging productivity is that I have been severely distracted by that thing that many postdocs are -- career. It's a pretty neat job being a postdoc. Like a PhD you've got more time to dig deep into a topic but you're more on top of your skills. It's flexible, it's a great way to get work abroad, you can wear a T-shirt to work and so on. It's a nice job.</p> <p>Eventually you do start to want a permanent position. Now in academia these are hard to get and there's very little geographic control. Many have written long and angrily about this, that's not what I want to get into. It is what it is. From a practical point of view it as an excellent time to think about whether you really want that academic job -- do you want to stick of twist? In my case I've gone for twist.</p> <p>This autumn I'll be making the move from statistical physics to statistical, er, statistics. My physics work was gradually slipping towards data science and I can't resist any longer (it's the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2012/09/27/data-scientists-the-definition-of-sexy/">sexiest job</a> of the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2013/03/18/so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist">21st century</a> don't you know!). Actually I want to post about that physics/data work at some point but need to wait for reviews etc.</p> <p>I'm really excited about my new position and all the new things I'll be learning. If possible I'd like to keep this blog going, I think there's a decent cross over with what I'll be doing next. The themes might switch more towards data than soft matter but statistics are statistics. It'll be a little sad leaving physics but I'll always see the world through a stat-mech lens, which is no bad thing for anyone in my opinion.</p>
