I've taken the domain name, kineticallyconstrained.com. For now don't change anything as the exact address might move about a bit. I haven't quite worked out what sub domains to use blah blah blah.<br /><br />Eventually I plan to put some permanent content and develop the site a bit. For now, to be honest, I'm mostly testing that the RSS feed is still working!
