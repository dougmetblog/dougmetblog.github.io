My spritely return has been a bit slower than I thought. However, thanks to the lovely people who work in the Dutch medical system I'm pretty much back.<br /><br />Long winded post on the thermodynamic limit coming very shortly, then a follow up on ergodicity that I've been toying with. I've also got a new spin on the criticality videos that demonstrates the renormalisation group in action â€“ I'm really really pleased with this video. Oh, and I'm at a conference next week so I'll round up some of the nice talks. There are a couple on critical Casimir forces so I may be compelled to put something down about that.<br /><br />So lots coming up.
