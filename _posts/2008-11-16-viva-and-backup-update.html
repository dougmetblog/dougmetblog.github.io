I thought I'd return to backups briefly and say how I was getting on with some of the web based ones. Initially I was using Mozy but after some problems with the software I uninstalled it. I'm too impatient to fix problems with this sort of programme so I ditched it. Live mesh, on the other hand, just worked. I have to say I'm getting on well with it. I don't really have a lot to say about it except that it's relatively unobtrusive and I don't think it's slowing the computer down too much.<br /><br />In other news I passed my viva! Hopefully this means I can start talking about statistical physics more which is sort of what I wanted to do with this blog in the first place.
