<a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jun/10/hummingbird-fastest-animal-fighter-jet">Relative to their body size</a>. Which completely changes everything. According to the Guardian<br /><br /><blockquote>They can cover more body lengths per second than any other vertebrate and for their size can even outpace fighter jets and the space shuttle</blockquote><br />Which is nice, and the high speed photo is beautiful. But it's not really the same is it? In fact the space shuttle statistic sort of makes it seem silly. All the other important numbers, apart from velocity, don't scale with the animal size. The friction, reaction time, not least the speed of sound. It doesn't help me imagine what it feels like to be a hummingbird.<br /><br />It's somewhat similar to all those statistics you see about insects. Fleas jumping hundreds of times their height and ants carrying many times their body weight. If you had a giant ant I doubt this strength thing continue, the strength of skeletons and legs just don't scale with height.<br /><br />The dive tops out at 60mph which is pretty impressive, I'd love to know it in perspective with the reaction times of the birds. How does 60mph feel to them? Apparently at the bottom of the dive<br /><br /><blockquote>the hummingbirds experienced an acceleration force nearly nine times that of gravity, the highest recorded for any vertebrate undergoing a voluntary aerial manoeuvre, with the exception of jet fighter pilots. At 7g, most pilots experience blackouts.</blockquote><br />That's definitely cool. So long as by g they don't mean in units of bird length again. Anyway, don't want to be too grouchy, the photo is excellent - enjoy.<br /><br /><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/01/images/hummingbird.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/01/images/hummingbird.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 306px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 385px;" /></a> Photo by Christopher J.
