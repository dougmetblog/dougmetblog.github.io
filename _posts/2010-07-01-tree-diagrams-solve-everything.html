Just a quick one. I saw this post, <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60598/title/When_intuition_and_math_probably_look_wrong">When intuition and math probably look wrong</a>, via Ben Goldacre's <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://delicious.com/bengoldacre">mini blog</a>. The problem is set as follows:<br /><blockquote>I have two children, one of whom is a son born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that I have two boys?</blockquote>Intuition tells you the answer is 1/2, mathematicians tell you it's something else. I'll leave the answer until the end of the post in case you want to run off and solve it first. It's essentially a fancier version of the <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a>.<br /><a name='more'></a>The <a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://sciencenews.org/">Science News</a> article deals with this just fine so I don't really want to expand on it. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was their grid visualisation. It didn't really make anything any clearer for me. No, the only way to go is a good old fashioned tree diagram. So I thought I'd just show how I solve pretty much all probability problems, as techniques go it's slow but you always get the right answer - no intuition required.<br /><br />The basic approach is to follow all possible scenarios and split the probabilities of all the events. From the information here we split three events. A child is born, it is either a girl (1/2) or a boy (1/2). We care if the boy was born on a Tuesday or not so we'll add this as a possibility. I like to put everything over a common denominator so we have: girl (7/14), boy not Tuesday (6/14), boy Tuesday (1/14). On the diagram this goes<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/TCx3DlGylwI/AAAAAAAABrA/SePIDfw8Vw4/s1600/tree1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/TCx3DlGylwI/AAAAAAAABrA/SePIDfw8Vw4/s320/tree1.png" width="206" /></a></div>Now we have another child, everything's independent so we have the same possibilities on each branch. We just multiply through the probabilities and keep the common denominator to get<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a bitly="BITLY_PROCESSED" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/TCx4SY_9wqI/AAAAAAAABrQ/D91OS1AoQ18/s1600/tree3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="387" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zWFdJl7vhzA/TCx4SY_9wqI/AAAAAAAABrQ/D91OS1AoQ18/s400/tree3.png" width="400" /></a></div>We can use this to solve all girl, boy, boy on Tuesday related questions. Given one child is a boy born on a Tuesday we select all final states that satisfy this (highlighted in red). If you add up their numbers this is a total of 27 out of the 196. Of these 27 where there is one boy born on a Tuesday we count the ones where the other child is a boy (b or t). This comes to a total 13 of the final states. <br /><br />And that's it. Of the 27 possibilities where one child is a boy born on Tuesday, 13 have another boy, so the answer is <b>13/27</b>.<br /><br />Note, if the question had been phrased "My <i>first</i> child was a boy born on Tuesday..." then you see we follow down the bottom branch and the problem returns to the intuitive answer. If this post seems a bit too elementary then I apologise. It just seems like no one ever mentions tree diagrams as a technique, preferring instead to make the problem seem really hard by banging on about Bayes' theorem and conditional probabilities and so on. They're all in there, just hidden out of view.<br /><br />I like tree diagrams because setting one up is pretty mechanical and solving the problem just becomes a question of event counting. You certainly don't need to worry about Bayes' theorem or anything fancy sounding. And once again, <i>no intuition required</i>.<br /><br />Which is good because my intuition is crap.
