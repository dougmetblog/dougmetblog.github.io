Stumbled across a few nice things related to quorum decision making recently. Remember how <a href="http://kineticallyconstrained.blogspot.com/2009/01/busy-bees.html">sticklebacks make their decisions</a>? Well bacteria do it too, below is a great TED talk by Bonnie Bassler on how they communicate and how they decide to act as an enormous group.<br /><br /><object width="446" height="326"><param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"></param> <param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/embed/BonnieBassler_2009-embed_high.flv&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/BonnieBassler-2009.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=432&vh=240&ap=0&ti=509" /><embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="446" height="326" allowFullScreen="true" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/embed/BonnieBassler_2009-embed_high.flv&su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/BonnieBassler-2009.embed_thumbnail.jpg&vw=432&vh=240&ap=0&ti=509"></embed></object><br /><br />Also came across <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/kasparov-versus-the-world/">this article</a> on humans making group decisions in a Kasparov vs The World chess game. It gets the saliva flowing on how you can engineer good decisions.<br /><br />Addition: Incidentally, I also think this talk is a great example of how to give a science talk. It's a little rushed (probably nerves) but the enthusiasm is fantastic and the use of visual aids is perfect. I'm giving a workshop on presentations so I've been thinking about this stuff a lot recently.
