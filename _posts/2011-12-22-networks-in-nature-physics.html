For those with access, looks like Nature Physics has a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v8/n1/index.html">complexity issue</a>. With articles by&nbsp;Barab√°si&nbsp;and Newman and the likes, it looks like it has a solid networks bent.<br /><br />There's a paper on&nbsp;community&nbsp;structure by my favourite physicist, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v8/n1/abs/nphys2162.html">Mark Newman</a>, that I'm looking forward to reading.<br /><br />Enjoy!
